## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

- ### **Why should I use Lock256 over other popular password managers?**
    Lock256 doesn't offer much more than your standard password manager *yet*, making other password managers probably a better choice overall. Why am I saying this? Well, I made this program mainly as a personal challenge; see the next question.
- ### **Why did you start development on Lock256?**
    I started development on Lock256 in order to put both my computer science and cybersecurity skills to the test. Lock256 requires quite a bit of knowledge regarding how to safely implement encryption algorithms into a functioning computer program, which is exactly why I am actively working on this program. My end goal is to have a secure password manager with all the standard mainstream features plus some unprecedented new ones.
- ### **Where can I find your future plans (TODO's) for Lock256?**
    I record my checklist of features/bugs in the "TODO" file in the root directory of the project.
