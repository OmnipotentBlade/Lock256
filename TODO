General Lock256 Todo:
  ☐ @critical Add secure AES-256 encryption to the program (google tink didn't work out)
  ☐ @low Add dark mode to the program (using a background overlay?)
  ✔ @today Test other password managers and take note of what features they do right and what standards exist @done(22-08-02 21:14)
    Findings:
      ☐ Auto sign-out after a certain period of time (minutes) for enhanced security (can be toggled off in settings if user considers it annoying)
      ☐ Folders for organizing stored credentials
      ☐ Stores more than just passwords; also stores credit cards, notes, and home addresses.
        - Notes function doesn't suit a password manager well, home addresses are too personal and pose a higher security risk if implemented.
      ☐ Password Health feature that checks saved credentials for weak passwords, password that are reused among other accounts, and old passwords.
        - The check for old passwords is not particularly necessary.
      ☐ Sync passwords across different devices (mobile, web browser (extensions), pc)
        - Requires online functionality and hosting a web server
          - Hosting a web server requires funding and diving deeper into webdev, networking, and web encryption and secure delivery of credentials
      ☐ Importing pre-existing password databases from web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
        - Usually in the format of a .csv or .xml file
  ✔ @high Figure out how to use GridBagLayout @done(22-08-10 12:54)
  ☐ @low Add original lock256 minimal icon (smaller one) because for macOS because it's too large in the taskbar/dock
  
  StartupFrame:
    ☐ @low Add logo banner to the top of StartupFrame

  MainFrame:
    ✔ @low Add feedback/bug report button in the main menu of MainFrame @done(22-08-08 15:28)
    ☐ @high Implement functionality where the program fetches a corresponding image to the website that the user provides in their new credentials entry (look into java.net.URL)
    ☐ @today Add icons and corresponding text to program sidebar
