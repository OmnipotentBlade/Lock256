# Lock256

Lock256 is an advanced password manager that takes advantage of the AES-256 encryption algorithm.
This is my first significant project of Q1 & Q2 2022, and it is also a refined version of the password manager that was included in my beginner C++ project (ProgramManager).

## Features
- Secure AES-256 Encryption
- Customizable Random Password Generator (includes bulk .txt feature)
- Graphical User Interface using Swing + AWT Libraries
